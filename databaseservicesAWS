  Key concepts

  Relational Databases
  			Relational database is organised into tables and related withi each other by keys. if we do not need complex join queries or transaction then consider NoSql database.

  NoSql Databases
  		NoSql database provides schema flexibility(it supports for Json Document model). NoSql tables are schemaless. it can be used to store Json style documents or key-value pairs

 DB instance 
 	it is an isolated database environment in cloud. Each DB instance contains multiple databases. DB instance is a basic building block of Relational database system.

 To lunch a DB instance we are selecting the following options
     - Database engine(it can be mySQl, Microsoft sql server, oracle or postgreySQL)
     - Database classes(to set up a computing and memory capabilities for DB engine)
     - we can define the security group for DB instances(security group means to push access control according to define rules)
